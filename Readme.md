# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This mini project predicts house prices using various regression models based on features like number of rooms, area, location, etc.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score
5. Visualization of results

## 📈 Output
The trained model can predict the house price based on input property features.

## 🚀 Goal
To understand regression-based ML models and apply them to real-world price prediction tasks.
